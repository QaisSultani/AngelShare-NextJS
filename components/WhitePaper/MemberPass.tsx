        Having minted an Angelshare Bottle NFT from Angelshare, you will be
        gifted the Angelshare Member Pass. This is a non-transferrable Soulbound
        Token that is airdropped to you after minting the Angelshare Bottle NFT.
        <br />
        <br /> Angelshare Member Pass holders may additionally get access to
        perks such as private whisky events, cask and bottle pre-sale
        opportunities, and exclusive sample shares after the main mint event is
        completed.
        <br />
        <br /> Concurrently, Angelshare partners with private bars and venues to
        offer a place where members can discuss ideas, make deals, or simply
        enjoy fine spirits. The spaces are envisaged as highly exclusive venues
        that house some of the worldâ€™s finest and hard to access whiskies, along
        with an environment that captivates members.
        <br />
        <br /> Entrance and access to facilities will be strictly only for
        NFT-carrying members plus a limited number of invitees. Members will
        have access to syndicated deal flow and early dibs on new cask
        allocations. Enabling these private investment and syndicated deals,
        cask bottlings, storage of spirits bought, etc., will all be developed
        around the ownership of the NFTs. We intend to develop and build the
        Angelshare community using Web3 tools.
