        The genesis edition of Angelshare Bottle NFTs begins with “Angelshare
        001”, representing the absolute first cohort of Angelshare members. The
        collection is limited to 160 bottles belonging to a 32 Year Old Talisker
        Cask of Distinction Single Malt Whisky, exclusively sourced and bottled
        from the distillery through our partner Diageo. Each bottle is an
        Angelshare bottle, officially labelled “Angelshare 001”.
        <br />
        <br /> Casks of Distinction are individual, unique casks that represent
        incredibly rare whiskies with an extraordinary quality and character.
        They are hand-selected by master blenders and made available only by
        invitation to select private clients. Each bottle will be serialised
        along with the token contract address and packaged in a Wooden box and
        crystal bottle from the Distiller.

        Physical Bottle Redemption
      </div>
      <div className="font-Glacial text-[20px] leading-[30px]">
        After the minting of the Angelshare Bottle NFTs, their physical
        counterparts will become available for redemption at our facility in
        Singapore in approximately 3 to 6 months. It is important to note that
        the Angelshare Bottle NFT serves as a digital certificate verifying the
        right to ownership of a physcial bottle – meaning that the digital
        versions are assets that can be traded on any open marketplace (such as
        OpenSea) before the physical bottle is redeemed. Upon redemption of the
        physical bottle, however, the digital version will be ‘burned’, and
        therefore unavailable to be traded or transferred as a digital asset.
        <br /> <br /> Some owners may choose to retain the bottle at our
        facility in Singapore and hold the digital collectible as a tradable
        asset.
